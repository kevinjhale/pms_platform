All of these tasks should be done with sub-agents at your discretion
* When leaving the dashboard and entering a sub-section, include a back arrow to return to the dashboard without having to click the dashboard button in the top nav.
* Remove the hover animation on all of the tables showing that I am hovering it. That should only happen on a button that I am able to press
* Add a thin black border around the buttons that have the same color background as the subsection. For example, in the properties subsection in the landlord dashboard, the Add Property button looks good but I cannot see a border around the View All button.
* Include hours spent in the maintenance actions section
* Add a button to create a new maintenance ticket from the Maintenance page. This is from the perspective of the landlord or property manager
* Add a button on the maintenance tasks to archive tasks. Also add a button to archive all tasks that are completed and have been completed for longer than 7 days
* Make the maintenance ticket window sortable and filterable by category, status, property, unit, landlord and or property manager
* I get a 404 when attempting to edit a unit within a property. This error came from editing unit 302 in prop-3 which is assigned to pm.lisa@demo.com. I also cannot edit the property
* Add a section for settings where the landlord or property manager can invite others to the organization. This part may need to be more in depth where one property manager can view properties and applications from several different landlords or property managers. How do you suggest tackling this problem?
* In the settings page, display the users information as stored in the database such as their user id, organization name, organization id, email, etc
