Let's mix things up a bit. Instead of showing the different pages in individual cards, lets organize them into a collapsible nav bar on the left side of the screen. When clicked on, take them to that page. Make them drillable as well so they can do "quick actions" like "Add Property" from the sub menu of Properties. Add a setting that allows the user to decide which page is set as the default. The default dashboard page should originally be the Reports and Analytics page. With this change, you can remove the back button with the sub-pages
